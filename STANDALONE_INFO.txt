STANDALONE GEOJSON PROCESSOR
============================

This is a self-contained, portable GeoJSON processing tool.


TO USE IN A NEW PROJECT:
------------------------
1. Copy this entire 'geojson-processor-standalone' folder to your new project directory
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Add your resort data to data/resort_name/ folder
4. Configure resorts in config/resorts.yaml
5. Run: python scripts/process_resort.py --resort your_resort_name

WHAT IT DOES:
-------------
- Clips OSM features to ski resort boundaries
- Generates individual tree points within forest polygons
- Uses tiered density algorithm (small/medium/large areas)
- Processes boundary zones with styling properties
- Outputs combined GeoJSON with all features


FILES INCLUDED:
---------------
- README.md - Usage instructions
- requirements.txt - Python dependencies (minimal)
- config/resorts.yaml - Resort configurations
- src/processor.py - Core GeoJSON processing logic
- src/constants.py - Processing constants
- scripts/process_resort.py - Single resort processing
- scripts/batch_process.py - Batch processing
- data/ - Input data directory (add your GeoJSON files here)
- output/ - Generated output directory

This tool is completely independent and can be used in any project that needs
to process ski resort boundary and OSM feature data into combined GeoJSON files.
